# WhiteBoard

WhiteBoard: A .NET application for a real-time, interactive drawing board MVC. This project worked by having code that
configured a C# SignalR real-time chat client, database repository, and frontend JavaScript canvas to display artwork
collectively so that users could draw together in real-time.
